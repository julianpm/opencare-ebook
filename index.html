							<h3>Chapter 1:</h3>
							<h2>What dentistry will look like post COVID-19</h2>
							<p>Written by Theeba Chuciyanthan, Practice Partnership Manager and Dr. Natalie Archer, DDS</p>
						</div>
						<div class="main-content_content">
							<p>COVID-19 brought an unprecedented shift in everyday life. Global industries were halted as controlling spread of the virus became an international priority. The public shifted their attitude towards infection control and sanitization. It heightened people’s sense of fear around the spread of germs. You’d be hard-pressed to find somewhere with more rigorously set up for infection control than a dentist office, but there is still a sense of fear looming over getting back to the dentist. You will need to adapt your patient experience to give your patients absolute confidence that they are in the safest hands possible.</p>
							<h4>The Patient Experience Now vs Then</h4>
							<p>Prior to COVID-19, a patient would walk into the dental office, speak to the front staff. The staff may even shake hands with the patient to make the patient feel comfortable. The patient typically sits in the waiting room next to others, possibly reading a magazine or if they are a child playing with toys until the dentist calls them in. Once in the dental chair, the dentist will explain all procedures with caring and calming facial expressions to make the patient feel at ease.</p>
							<p>With the current climate, patients will be screened by phone ahead of time and be questioned to ensure they do not have any COVID-19 symptoms. Dental offices will likely be locked with only one doorbell access which means the single patient entry. The patient will be arriving in a mask to speak to hygienists and front staff who are also in a mask. The patient will no longer have the luxurious waiting room experience that practices create to ensure the patients feel comfortable.There will no longer be magazines or toys for entertainment as these items are difficult to disinfect and non-essential. Payment methods will likely be touchless such as a credit card or interac and should be communicated to patients. Once in the chair, the dentist must rely on their tone of voice to make the patient feel comfortable.</p>
							<h4>Advice from the dental community</h4>
							<p>We spoke with top rated dentists across North America on their advice for navigating the new patient experience.</p>
							<p>Former Vice President of the Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario, Dr. Natalie Archer, thinks that teledentistry is a great and innovative way to conduct initial patient screening for non emergency patients. It helps keep you and your staff safe while still providing great patient care. Patients appreciate convenience, ease of use and speedy service, this is where chatbots can be introduced. Although patients can't just drop in, you can still make the patient feel as though you are easily accessible.</p>
							<p><a class="tab-link" href="#chapter5">Is teledentistry the new normal? See chapter 5.</a></p>
							<p>Dr. Jeanie Luong, a top-rated Toronto dentist, advises to utilise resources from the dental community such as <a target="_blank" href="https://dentalcommunity.ca/">webinars</a> where you can hear advice from dental offices who have reopened in other countries. Dr Luong’s office is taking the time to provide her staff vigorous training to ensure precautionary measures are being taken for infection control of the highest standards. Additionally she has implemented increased screening which includes temperature checks for each patient.</p>
							<p>She has also implemented engineering controls to reduce exposure to the virus such as plexiglass barriers, each operatory room has been sealed with plastic doors, her appointments are spaced out to reduce contact. One of the most important changes she has made at the office is introducing hand scaling whereas prior to COVID-19 hygienists may have used cavitron that vibrated to physically break off plaque, this may be something patients will not see for a while.</p>
							<p>The final control mechanism to protect staff and patients is increased PPE. This includes face shields, gowns , and N95 masks (precautionarily).</p>
							<p>“In these times of uncertainty I can only focus on things that I have control over, which is staying calm, evaluating information critically, and being available to my patients in any way I can. I encourage dentists to stay in touch with your patients and your team members. “ -Dr. Jeanie Luong</p>
							<p>Dentistry will not look or feel the same for even a few years, as the impact of covid will leave the public with a heightened fear of viral spread and germs. By providing the best patient experience, being consistent with your sanitization protocols, and communicating effectively with your patients, you will be ready to reopen to provide the essential preventative healthcare that your patients are keen to get back to.</p>

							<h3>Chapter 2:</h3>
							<h2>Why focusing on the patient experience is more important than financial recovery</h2>
							<p>Written by Alycia Harris, Dental Marketing Specialist and Dr. Jeanie Luong</p>
						</div>
						<div class="main-content_content">
							<p>After regulators and health authorities across North America recommended dentists stop routine patient appointments in March, the dental industry was hit hard. Without a consistent patient flow, many offices felt a major slow in revenue.</p>
							<h4>What makes dentistry unique?</h4>
							<p>Dentistry relies on a really unique relationship between supply and demand. Unlike many businesses, the COVID-19 pandemic won’t result in a “loss” of revenue, but rather a “deferral” of revenue. To put this into perspective, a restaurant will be directly losing revenue for each meal they don’t sell. The person who would have gone to the restaurant to have a drink and some food is putting that transaction toward making food at home or getting take out. In the same sense, a gym will be losing revenue for every month they can’t fulfill the membership for their customers.</p>
							<p>Dentistry is unique because it provides a preventative service. COVID-19 didn’t stop the demand for dentistry; it only deferred it. Toothaches, cavities, cleanings, gum problems, and wisdom teeth impacts don’t just go away, but rather they get pushed into a backlog. Dentists should take comfort in the fact that COVID-19 or any major crisis will never reduce the demand for preventative healthcare. While the pandemic may have rendered dental offices “non-essential”, dentistry and the services you passionately provide your patients every day are certainly essential to the health of a population.</p>
							<p>As we recover from the impact of the pandemic, it is important to understand that your revenue was not necessarily not lost, only deferred. Take the time you have to prioritize your patients.  The value of the essential services you provide remains strong, and a strong backlog of eager patients is waiting for you.</p>
							<p>Don’t look at the pandemic as a loss, but look at it as an opportunity to re-shift your strategy for the best patient experience.</p>
							<h4>Optimize your appointment flow</h4>
							<h4>→ Address your backlog:</h4>
							<p>Make sure every patient who had an appointment cancelled or deferred is rebooked. Patient loyalty is key to driving their Lifetime value, which will guarantee revenue for future appointments. Make sure to leave time each week to service patients who have been waiting to be seen. Help ensure preventative measures are taken as soon as possible for your patients. In a June 2020 survey of our patients across North America, 66% noted that they had an appointment cancelled due to COVID-19, and 91% of them intend on rebooking once dentists reopen.</p>
							<h4>→ Space out your appointments to abide by sanitization best practices</h4>
							<p>Leave time in between each patient to diligently and thoroughly follow recommended protocols for infection control. Take every careful step to ensure your staff are trained and your equipment is properly sanitized. See best practices for sanitization in Chapter 3. Many dentists have expressed the need to extend their office hours or open their office for more days of the week in order to accommodate these extended hours. Please do this within reason. Make sure you are taking breaks and only ramping up your services to a limited degree. While cash flow is a major concern, it is important to ensure each patient is receiving thorough and quality service, rather than rushed appointments from a dentist experiencing burnout.</p>
							<h4>→ Write out your services and prioritize them.</h4>
							<p>Dental emergencies and treating immediate pain will likely take precedence over routine check-ups. However, it is important to prioritize your services and use that as a guide for scheduling new patients. Cosmetics and teeth whitening should take a back seat to preventative and essential oral care.</p>
							<h4>→ Use a patient <a href="http://www.opencare.com" target="_">booking platform</a> to do your scheduling for you</h4>
							<p>You should expect inconsistent patient flow in the wake of the pandemic. Booking patients may take patience, time, and thought as economies start to reopen. A booking platform helps guarantee patient flow, connects you with quality health-keen patients, and makes the scheduling processes much more efficient for your front office staff.</p>
							<h4>Communicating with your patients</h4>
							<p>“As a profession, we need to do our part to communicate with patients and earn their trust. We’re going to be responsible stewards of their safety. I believe that's going to have a huge impact on getting things as close to normal as possible”-- Dr. Jeanie Luong</p>
							<p>There are many easy and low cost ways of keeping in touch with your patients during this time. It is imperative to be there to reassure and build trust with your patient base.</p>
							<ul><li><h4>Email Engagement</h4></li></ul>
							<p>A high-quality patient experience starts before they even enter the door of your office. Keep your patients engaged by reaching out to them through e-mails. A <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats" target="_blank">Hubspot study</a> found that 80% of business professionals believe that email marketing increases customer retention. More than 50% of U.S. respondents check their personal email account more than 10 times a day, and it is by far their preferred way to receive updates from brands.The ADA has provided a great <a href="https://pages.ada.org/return-to-work-toolkit-american-dental-association">guide</a> on drafting your first “Welcome Back” e-Mail to patients. This will ensure strengthened trust and communication with your patient base.</p>
							<p>Need ideas for COVID rengagement e-mails? Try these:</p>
							<p>→ A reassurance e-mail on sanitization</p>
							<p>→ A personal and informed <a href="https://pages.ada.org/return-to-work-toolkit-american-dental-association" target="_blank">welcome back e-mail</a></p>
							<p>→ Tips and advice for at home oral wellness</p>
							<p>→ A self-diagnosis tool for common problems</p>
							<p>→ Dental emergency guidelines</p>
							<p>→  A survey to help gauge their feelings about going to the dentist</p>
							<p>→ Resources and content that you find useful from dental thought leaders</p>
							<ul><li><h4>Leverage social media</h4></li></ul>
							<p>Social media is a great platform for getting to know your patients and keeping them engaged when they’re not in your chair. <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-statistics-for-social-media-managers/#general" target="_blank">90%</a> of North Americans between 18-29 use social mediaIf your practice isn’t using social media, you’ll miss out on endless opportunities to reach these people. Social media is an incredible way to promote yourself and stay in contact with patients.</p>
							<p>Here are some great ways to use social media to engage your audience on social media to answer questions about reopening after COVID-19:</p>
							<p>→ <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-live-tips/" target="_blank">Go live!</a> Interact with your patients in real time</p>
							<p>→ Use the poll and answer features on Instagram Stories to get real input from your patients.You can respond and engage them directly.</p>
							<p>→ Post useful and insightful tips as images</p>
							<p>→ Do officer tours and demonstrate the extended measure for sanitization your office is taking</p>
							<p>→ Use the direct messaging feature to speak personally with patients who might have questions about visiting during the pandemic</p>
							<p>→ Try to post consistently (2-3 times per week) to optimize engagement</p>
							<ul><li><h4>Survey Patients</h4></li></ul>
							<p>Surveys help gauge your patients’ personal feelings by streamlining qualitative data into quantitative answers for analysis. Sometimes, the smiles or kind words at the end of dental appointments might not tell the whole story. Regularly surveying patients can help suss out issues that should be dealt with promptly or help you adjust your strategy for reaching out. It also helps you understand larger stories and insights about how the pandemic changed your patients’ mindset towards dentistry.</p>
							<p>There are many ways to survey patients. Websites like <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/" target="_blank">SurveyMonkey</a> and <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/" target="_blank">Qualtrics</a> provide survey tools for businesses, but sometimes at a cost. Companies on a budget can also access free survey tools through Google Drive.</p>
							<h4>Wellness for you: Financial aid and mental health resources</h4>
							<p>There are many resources available for financial aid from both the Canadian and U.S. government for practices across North America. Are you a small business? Are you a family-owned practice? Are you a woman who owns a business? There are amazing resources available during the COVID-19 pandemic to support you financially.</p>
							<p>Your wellness is a priority. There are also many resources available for mental wellness. We encourage you to share the below resources with your team, loved ones and friends within the dentistry industry. We are in this together and prioritizing mental health is an important value for us. We hope you find these resources helpful during this difficult time, and we’re here to support you in any way we can.</p>

							<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
							<h2>How to ease your patients’ minds: Best practices for patient safety</h2>
							<p>Written by Samie Durnford, Health and Wellness Writer and Dr. Jeanie Luong, DDS</p>
						</div>
						<div class="main-content_content">
							<p>It’s no secret that this pandemic has shaken up life as we know it. Patients have been staying at home and avoiding their family and friends, not to mention interacting with businesses, to stay safe. Many of your patients are worried about what the future holds all together, on top of wondering if it’s safe for them to leave their house. Your job as a medical practitioner is to help guide your patients through this time of change.</p>
							<h4>Are your patients ready to go back to the dentist?</h4>
							<p>We want to help alleviate the fear of going back to the dentist. Many industry experts assumed that the pandemic would kill people’s enthusiasm to return to the dentist due to the nature of aerosols in the dental office. However, results from a recent June 2020 survey we conducted with over 2000 patients across North America tell a very different story. 42% of respondents said they plan to visit their dentist within three months of their office being reopened, with 34% of those respondents saying they would visit as soon as possible. Only 5% of respondents noted they will only go if it’s an emergency.</p>
							<p>Of the respondents unsure if they’ll go back to the dentist anytime soon, 45% said they’re waiting for life to go back to “normal”, with 42% answering that they’re scared about getting COVID-19. The rest of the respondents were not insured or chose “other”.</p>
							<p>Patients are keen and excited about getting back to the dentist. So your priority is no longer to alleviate the fear of going to the dentist, but rather make your patients feel 100% safe when they get in your chair.</p>
							<h4>What can you do to make your patients feel safe?</h4>
							<p>When we asked out Opencare patients what they’d say the minimum requirements a dentist must do to make them feel safe for a routine cleaning/checkup:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>85% said they’d want to see their dentist wearing increased infection control equipment such as an N95 mask, face shield, and gloves</li>
								<li>59% said they’d like to see masks available for patients</li>
								<li>58% said they’d like to see contactless sign-in</li>
								<li>49% don’t want to be in a waiting room</li>
								<li>40% want to see air purifiers in the office</li>
							</ul>
							<p>“I worry that at the dentist, there are dental tools placed in our mouths, and dentists are in close contact with other people and hard surfaces which may carry the virus. I also have concerns with how long offices will continue with extra cleaning,” said one respondent from the Greater Toronto Area.</p>
							<p>Patients are nervous, and understandably so. But, there are things you can do to ease their mind.</p>
							<h4>1. Visible sanitization</h4>
							<p>The best thing you can do to ease the mind of your patients is make sure that sanitation measures are followed and visible. Masks, hand sanitizer, and visible sanitization measures are things that should be done at minimum in front of your patients to show them that they’re safe. Now is the time for extra transparency.</p>
							<p>When asked about what would make them feel safe, one survey respondent said "reassurance of how all tools cleaned and sterilized. Make me feel like what you’re putting in my mouth is super clean." Even though dentists have been, and already are, extremely vigilant about sanitation, it’s important to talk about it and let your patients know the steps you’re taking to keep them safe.</p>
							<p>As you open a new pack of tools, say, “These tools have been sanitized using our sanitization process which includes…”. That little bit of information goes a long way when it comes to client safety.</p>
							<h4>2. Minimize interactions with people</h4>
							<p>Social distancing is one of the main ways we can all do our part to stop the spread of the virus. Your patients want to avoid unnecessary contact with people, and one of the ways you can do that is by allowing for contactless check-in, plexiglass between your front desk team and your patients, and ensuring that your waiting room is always empty.</p>
							<p>Many patients are worried there will be a rush of visitors to the dentist, with one saying “"I imagine dentists will be crowded, so I won't plan on going until I feel things have slowed down." To combat this, send an email to your patients who are due for a cleaning or had a cancellation or call them and let them know what you’re doing to minimize foot traffic in your office.</p>
							<p>One great suggestion from our survey respondents was: "A virtual waiting room please, so I don’t have to wait in a line outside the office." This is a great time to use technology to our advantage. Use apps, like Opencare, to communicate with your patients and iPads to check in. Ask your patients to wait in the car and give them a call or text when it’s time to come in so only one patient enters at a time.</p>
							<h4>3. Display safety standards and proof of infection control</h4>
							<p>When we asked our patients how they felt about their dentist having proof of infection control and following proper sanitation guidelines, 29% said they felt very confident and trusted their dentist to follow proper protocol. Another 40% said they felt confident, while 18% said they felt worried and 12% said they felt very worried and would want to see certification or proof.</p>
							<p>Much like our first suggestion, make safety visible to ease your patient's mind. Display things like signs and symptoms of COVID-19, reminders to sanitize and wash hands for your staff, and you can even email your patient ahead of their appointments or message them on Opencare with a “What we’re doing to keep you safe” message.</p>
							<h4>Be the expert for your patients</h4>
							<p>As a dentist, it’s your role to be a wellness partner for your patient. Keep your patients up-to-date on dental regulations, new data and information, studies, and anything related to their oral wellness and COVID-19. Get ahead of the information and share it freely with your patients. This could be being active on social media or sending out a monthly email newsletter.</p>
							<p>When we asked our patients who they go to for information for questions and concerns about their oral health during the COVID-19 pandemic, 21% said they call their dentist, with 66% saying the turn to Google. A small number of patients turn to friends and family (7%), with only 2% turning to social media and other avenues.</p>
							<p>Patients want to hear from their dentist! In times of uncertainty and in a health crisis, your patients are going to look to you for the most accurate information. They trust you with their oral health, and it’s important that you instill confidence and are there for them as their partner. By doing this, you can set yourself apart from your competition and excel in patient excellence.</p>

						<div class="main-content_content">
							<p>Your team is the backbone of your practice, and it’s important to not only ease their minds, but to keep them safe every day they step into your office to work with patients. Chances are, your team is a little bit weary about working with COVID-19, even if they’re putting on a brave face. Understandably, dental offices everywhere are feeling a bit worried from time to time about what this whole pandemic means to them, and wonder if they’re doing everything possible to keep their office safe from the virus.</p>
							<p>Confidence is key, and the first step to keeping your office safe is being confident that you are doing everything possible to keep your office clean, your patients safe, and your employees trained and equipped to do the same.</p>

						<div class="main-content_content">
							<p>The topic of teledentistry is top of mind as an emerging industry now that COVID-19 has challenged dentists to think of where the future of their practice is headed. Teledentistry allows you to screen patients before they come into your practice to ensure they aren’t sick and haven’t been in contact with, or in a situation with COVID-19. It also allows you to understand patients' dental problems and screen them accordingly to best serve them.</p>
