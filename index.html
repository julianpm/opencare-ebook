					<h3>Chapter 1:</h3>
					<h2>What dentistry will look like post COVID-19</h2>
					<p>Written by Theeba Chuciyanthan, Practice Partnership Manager and Dr. Natalie Archer, DDS</p>
				</div>
				<div class="main-content_content">
					<p>COVID-19 brought an unprecedented shift in everyday life. Global industries were halted as controlling spread of the virus became an international priority. The public shifted their attitude towards infection control and sanitization. It heightened people’s sense of fear around the spread of germs. You’d be hard-pressed to find somewhere with more rigorously set up for infection control than a dentist office, but there is still a sense of fear looming over getting back to the dentist. You will need to adapt your patient experience to give your patients absolute confidence that they are in the safest hands possible.</p>
					<h4>The Patient Experience Now vs Then</h4>
					<p>Prior to COVID -19, a patient would walk into the dental office, speak to the front staff. The staff may even shake hands with the patient to make the patient feel comfortable. The patient typically sits in the waiting room next to others, possibly reading a magazine or if they are a child playing with toys until the dentist calls them in. Once in the dental chair, the dentist will explain all procedures with caring and calming facial expressions to make the patient feel at ease.</p>
					<p>With the current climate, patients will be screened by phone ahead of time and be questioned to ensure they do not have any COVID-19 symptoms. Dental offices will likely be locked with only one doorbell access which means the single patient entry. The patient will be arriving in a mask to speak to hygienists and front staff who are also in a mask. The patient will no longer have the luxurious waiting room experience that practices create to ensure the patients feel comfortable.There will no longer be magazines or toys for entertainment as these items are difficult to disinfect and non-essential. Payment methods will likely be touchless such as a credit card or interac and should be communicated to patients. Once in the chair, the dentist must rely on their tone of voice to make the patient feel comfortable.</p>
					<h4>Advice from the dental community</h4>
					<p>We spoke with top rated dentists across North America on their advice for navigating the new patient experience.</p>
					<p>Former Vice President of the Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario, Dr. Natalie Archer, thinks that teledentistry is a great and innovative way to conduct initial patient screening for non emergency patients. It helps keep you and your staff safe while still providing great patient care. Patients appreciate convenience, ease of use and speedy service, this is where chatbots can be introduced. Although patients can't just drop in, you can still make the patient feel as though you are easily accessible.</p>
					<p><a href="#chapter5">Is teledentistry the new normal? See chapter 5.</a></p>
					<p>Dr. Jeanie Luong, a top-rated Toronto dentist, advises to utilise resources from the dental community such as <a target="_blank" href="https://dentalcommunity.ca/">webinars</a> where you can hear advice from dental offices who have reopened in other countries. Dr Luong’s office is taking the time to provide her staff vigorous training to ensure precautionary measures are being taken for infection control of the highest standards. Additionally she has implemented increased screening which includes temperature checks for each patient.</p>
					<p>She has also implemented engineering controls to reduce exposure to the virus such as plexiglass barriers, each operatory room has been sealed with plastic doors, her appointments are spaced out to reduce contact. One of the most important changes she has made at the office is introducing hand scaling whereas prior to COVID-19 hygienists may have used cavitron that vibrated to physically break off plaque, this may be something patients will not see for a while.</p>
					<p>The final control mechanism to protect staff and patients is increased PPE. This includes face shields, gowns , and N95 masks (precautionarily).</p>
					<p>“In these times of uncertainty I can only focus on things that I have control over, which is staying calm, evaluating information critically, and being available to my patients in any way I can. I encourage dentists to stay in touch with your patients and your team members. “ -Dr. Jeanie Luong</p>
					<p>Dentistry will not look or feel the same for even a few years, as the impact of covid will leave the public with a heightened fear of viral spread and germs. By providing the best patient experience, being consistent with your sanitization protocols, and communicating effectively with your patients, you will be ready to reopen to provide the essential preventative healthcare that your patients are keen to get back to.</p>
