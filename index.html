							<h3>Chapter 1:</h3>
							<h2>What dentistry will look like post COVID-19</h2>
							<p>Written by Theeba Chuciyanthan, Practice Partnership Manager and Dr. Natalie Archer, DDS</p>
						</div>
						<div class="main-content_content">
							<p>COVID-19 brought an unprecedented shift in everyday life. Global industries were halted as controlling spread of the virus became an international priority. The public shifted their attitude towards infection control and sanitization. It heightened people’s sense of fear around the spread of germs. You’d be hard-pressed to find somewhere with more rigorously set up for infection control than a dentist office, but there is still a sense of fear looming over getting back to the dentist. You will need to adapt your patient experience to give your patients absolute confidence that they are in the safest hands possible.</p>
							<h4>The Patient Experience Now vs Then</h4>
							<p>Prior to COVID-19, a patient would walk into the dental office, speak to the front staff. The staff may even shake hands with the patient to make the patient feel comfortable. The patient typically sits in the waiting room next to others, possibly reading a magazine or if they are a child playing with toys until the dentist calls them in. Once in the dental chair, the dentist will explain all procedures with caring and calming facial expressions to make the patient feel at ease.</p>
							<p>With the current climate, patients will be screened by phone ahead of time and be questioned to ensure they do not have any COVID-19 symptoms. Dental offices will likely be locked with only one doorbell access which means the single patient entry. The patient will be arriving in a mask to speak to hygienists and front staff who are also in a mask. The patient will no longer have the luxurious waiting room experience that practices create to ensure the patients feel comfortable.There will no longer be magazines or toys for entertainment as these items are difficult to disinfect and non-essential. Payment methods will likely be touchless such as a credit card or interac and should be communicated to patients. Once in the chair, the dentist must rely on their tone of voice to make the patient feel comfortable.</p>
							<h4>Advice from the dental community</h4>
							<p>We spoke with top rated dentists across North America on their advice for navigating the new patient experience.</p>
							<p>Former Vice President of the Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario, Dr. Natalie Archer, thinks that teledentistry is a great and innovative way to conduct initial patient screening for non emergency patients. It helps keep you and your staff safe while still providing great patient care. Patients appreciate convenience, ease of use and speedy service, this is where chatbots can be introduced. Although patients can't just drop in, you can still make the patient feel as though you are easily accessible.</p>
							<p><a class="tab-link" href="#chapter5">Is teledentistry the new normal? See chapter 5.</a></p>
							<p>Dr. Jeanie Luong, a top-rated Toronto dentist, advises to utilise resources from the dental community such as <a target="_blank" href="https://dentalcommunity.ca/">webinars</a> where you can hear advice from dental offices who have reopened in other countries. Dr Luong’s office is taking the time to provide her staff vigorous training to ensure precautionary measures are being taken for infection control of the highest standards. Additionally she has implemented increased screening which includes temperature checks for each patient.</p>
							<p>She has also implemented engineering controls to reduce exposure to the virus such as plexiglass barriers, each operatory room has been sealed with plastic doors, her appointments are spaced out to reduce contact. One of the most important changes she has made at the office is introducing hand scaling whereas prior to COVID-19 hygienists may have used cavitron that vibrated to physically break off plaque, this may be something patients will not see for a while.</p>
							<p>The final control mechanism to protect staff and patients is increased PPE. This includes face shields, gowns , and N95 masks (precautionarily).</p>
							<p>“In these times of uncertainty I can only focus on things that I have control over, which is staying calm, evaluating information critically, and being available to my patients in any way I can. I encourage dentists to stay in touch with your patients and your team members. “ -Dr. Jeanie Luong</p>
							<p>Dentistry will not look or feel the same for even a few years, as the impact of covid will leave the public with a heightened fear of viral spread and germs. By providing the best patient experience, being consistent with your sanitization protocols, and communicating effectively with your patients, you will be ready to reopen to provide the essential preventative healthcare that your patients are keen to get back to.</p>

							<h3>Chapter 2:</h3>
							<h2>Why focusing on the patient experience is more important than financial recovery</h2>
							<p>Written by Alycia Harris, Dental Marketing Specialist and Dr. Jeanie Luong</p>
						</div>
						<div class="main-content_content">
							<p>After regulators and health authorities across North America recommended dentists stop routine patient appointments in March, the dental industry was hit hard. Without a consistent patient flow, many offices felt a major slow in revenue.</p>
							<h4>What makes dentistry unique?</h4>
							<p>Dentistry relies on a really unique relationship between supply and demand. Unlike many businesses, the COVID-19 pandemic won’t result in a “loss” of revenue, but rather a “deferral” of revenue. To put this into perspective, a restaurant will be directly losing revenue for each meal they don’t sell. The person who would have gone to the restaurant to have a drink and some food is putting that transaction toward making food at home or getting take out. In the same sense, a gym will be losing revenue for every month they can’t fulfill the membership for their customers.</p>
							<p>Dentistry is unique because it provides a preventative service. COVID-19 didn’t stop the demand for dentistry; it only deferred it. Toothaches, cavities, cleanings, gum problems, and wisdom teeth impacts don’t just go away, but rather they get pushed into a backlog. Dentists should take comfort in the fact that COVID-19 or any major crisis will never reduce the demand for preventative healthcare. While the pandemic may have rendered dental offices “non-essential”, dentistry and the services you passionately provide your patients every day are certainly essential to the health of a population.</p>
							<p>As we recover from the impact of the pandemic, it is important to understand that your revenue was not necessarily not lost, only deferred. Take the time you have to prioritize your patients.  The value of the essential services you provide remains strong, and a strong backlog of eager patients is waiting for you.</p>
							<p>Don’t look at the pandemic as a loss, but look at it as an opportunity to re-shift your strategy for the best patient experience.</p>
							<h4>Optimize your appointment flow</h4>
							<h4>→ Address your backlog:</h4>
							<p>Make sure every patient who had an appointment cancelled or deferred is rebooked. Patient loyalty is key to driving their Lifetime value, which will guarantee revenue for future appointments. Make sure to leave time each week to service patients who have been waiting to be seen. Help ensure preventative measures are taken as soon as possible for your patients. In a June 2020 survey of our patients across North America, 66% noted that they had an appointment cancelled due to COVID-19, and 91% of them intend on rebooking once dentists reopen.</p>
							<h4>→ Space out your appointments to abide by sanitization best practices</h4>
							<p>Leave time in between each patient to diligently and thoroughly follow recommended protocols for infection control. Take every careful step to ensure your staff are trained and your equipment is properly sanitized. See best practices for sanitization in Chapter 3. Many dentists have expressed the need to extend their office hours or open their office for more days of the week in order to accommodate these extended hours. Please do this within reason. Make sure you are taking breaks and only ramping up your services to a limited degree. While cash flow is a major concern, it is important to ensure each patient is receiving thorough and quality service, rather than rushed appointments from a dentist experiencing burnout.</p>
							<h4>→ Write out your services and prioritize them.</h4>
							<p>Dental emergencies and treating immediate pain will likely take precedence over routine check-ups. However, it is important to prioritize your services and use that as a guide for scheduling new patients. Cosmetics and teeth whitening should take a back seat to preventative and essential oral care.</p>
							<h4>→ Use a patient <a href="http://www.opencare.com" target="_">booking platform</a> to do your scheduling for you</h4>
							<p>You should expect inconsistent patient flow in the wake of the pandemic. Booking patients may take patience, time, and thought as economies start to reopen. A booking platform helps guarantee patient flow, connects you with quality health-keen patients, and makes the scheduling processes much more efficient for your front office staff.</p>
							<h4>Communicating with your patients</h4>
							<p>“As a profession, we need to do our part to communicate with patients and earn their trust. We’re going to be responsible stewards of their safety. I believe that's going to have a huge impact on getting things as close to normal as possible”-- Dr. Jeanie Luong</p>
							<p>There are many easy and low cost ways of keeping in touch with your patients during this time. It is imperative to be there to reassure and build trust with your patient base.</p>
							<ul><li><h4>Email Engagement</h4></li></ul>
							<p>A high-quality patient experience starts before they even enter the door of your office. Keep your patients engaged by reaching out to them through e-mails. A <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats" target="_blank">Hubspot study</a> found that 80% of business professionals believe that email marketing increases customer retention. More than 50% of U.S. respondents check their personal email account more than 10 times a day, and it is by far their preferred way to receive updates from brands.The ADA has provided a great <a href="https://pages.ada.org/return-to-work-toolkit-american-dental-association">guide</a> on drafting your first “Welcome Back” e-Mail to patients. This will ensure strengthened trust and communication with your patient base.</p>
							<p>Need ideas for COVID rengagement e-mails? Try these:</p>
							<p>→ A reassurance e-mail on sanitization</p>
							<p>→ A personal and informed <a href="https://pages.ada.org/return-to-work-toolkit-american-dental-association" target="_blank">welcome back e-mail</a></p>
							<p>→ Tips and advice for at home oral wellness</p>
							<p>→ A self-diagnosis tool for common problems</p>
							<p>→ Dental emergency guidelines</p>
							<p>→  A survey to help gauge their feelings about going to the dentist</p>
							<p>→ Resources and content that you find useful from dental thought leaders</p>
							<ul><li><h4>Leverage social media</h4></li></ul>
							<p>Social media is a great platform for getting to know your patients and keeping them engaged when they’re not in your chair. <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-statistics-for-social-media-managers/#general" target="_blank">90%</a> of North Americans between 18-29 use social mediaIf your practice isn’t using social media, you’ll miss out on endless opportunities to reach these people. Social media is an incredible way to promote yourself and stay in contact with patients.</p>
							<p>Here are some great ways to use social media to engage your audience on social media to answer questions about reopening after COVID-19:</p>
							<p>→ <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-live-tips/" target="_blank">Go live!</a> Interact with your patients in real time</p>
							<p>→ Use the poll and answer features on Instagram Stories to get real input from your patients.You can respond and engage them directly.</p>
							<p>→ Post useful and insightful tips as images</p>
							<p>→ Do officer tours and demonstrate the extended measure for sanitization your office is taking</p>
							<p>→ Use the direct messaging feature to speak personally with patients who might have questions about visiting during the pandemic</p>
							<p>→ Try to post consistently (2-3 times per week) to optimize engagement</p>
							<ul><li><h4>Survey Patients</h4></li></ul>
							<p>Surveys help gauge your patients’ personal feelings by streamlining qualitative data into quantitative answers for analysis. Sometimes, the smiles or kind words at the end of dental appointments might not tell the whole story. Regularly surveying patients can help suss out issues that should be dealt with promptly or help you adjust your strategy for reaching out. It also helps you understand larger stories and insights about how the pandemic changed your patients’ mindset towards dentistry.</p>
							<p>There are many ways to survey patients. Websites like <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/" target="_blank">SurveyMonkey</a> and <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/" target="_blank">Qualtrics</a> provide survey tools for businesses, but sometimes at a cost. Companies on a budget can also access free survey tools through Google Drive.</p>
							<h4>Wellness for you: Financial aid and mental health resources</h4>
							<p>There are many resources available for financial aid from both the Canadian and U.S. government for practices across North America. Are you a small business? Are you a family-owned practice? Are you a woman who owns a business? There are amazing resources available during the COVID-19 pandemic to support you financially.</p>
							<p>Your wellness is a priority. There are also many resources available for mental wellness. We encourage you to share the below resources with your team, loved ones and friends within the dentistry industry. We are in this together and prioritizing mental health is an important value for us. We hope you find these resources helpful during this difficult time, and we’re here to support you in any way we can.</p>

							<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
							<h2>How to ease your patients’ minds: Best practices for patient safety</h2>
							<p>Written by Samie Durnford, Health and Wellness Writer and Dr. Jeanie Luong, DDS</p>
						</div>
						<div class="main-content_content">
							<p>It’s no secret that this pandemic has shaken up life as we know it. Patients have been staying at home and avoiding their family and friends, not to mention interacting with businesses, to stay safe. Many of your patients are worried about what the future holds all together, on top of wondering if it’s safe for them to leave their house. Your job as a medical practitioner is to help guide your patients through this time of change.</p>
							<h4>Are your patients ready to go back to the dentist?</h4>
							<p>We want to help alleviate the fear of going back to the dentist. Many industry experts assumed that the pandemic would kill people’s enthusiasm to return to the dentist due to the nature of aerosols in the dental office. However, results from a recent June 2020 survey we conducted with over 2000 patients across North America tell a very different story. 42% of respondents said they plan to visit their dentist within three months of their office being reopened, with 34% of those respondents saying they would visit as soon as possible. Only 5% of respondents noted they will only go if it’s an emergency.</p>
							<p>Of the respondents unsure if they’ll go back to the dentist anytime soon, 45% said they’re waiting for life to go back to “normal”, with 42% answering that they’re scared about getting COVID-19. The rest of the respondents were not insured or chose “other”.</p>
							<p>Patients are keen and excited about getting back to the dentist. So your priority is no longer to alleviate the fear of going to the dentist, but rather make your patients feel 100% safe when they get in your chair.</p>
							<h4>What can you do to make your patients feel safe?</h4>
							<p>When we asked out Opencare patients what they’d say the minimum requirements a dentist must do to make them feel safe for a routine cleaning/checkup:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>85% said they’d want to see their dentist wearing increased infection control equipment such as an N95 mask, face shield, and gloves</li>
								<li>59% said they’d like to see masks available for patients</li>
								<li>58% said they’d like to see contactless sign-in</li>
								<li>49% don’t want to be in a waiting room</li>
								<li>40% want to see air purifiers in the office</li>
							</ul>
							<p>“I worry that at the dentist, there are dental tools placed in our mouths, and dentists are in close contact with other people and hard surfaces which may carry the virus. I also have concerns with how long offices will continue with extra cleaning,” said one respondent from the Greater Toronto Area.</p>
							<p>Patients are nervous, and understandably so. But, there are things you can do to ease their mind.</p>
							<h4>1. Visible sanitization</h4>
							<p>The best thing you can do to ease the mind of your patients is make sure that sanitation measures are followed and visible. Masks, hand sanitizer, and visible sanitization measures are things that should be done at minimum in front of your patients to show them that they’re safe. Now is the time for extra transparency.</p>
							<p>When asked about what would make them feel safe, one survey respondent said "reassurance of how all tools cleaned and sterilized. Make me feel like what you’re putting in my mouth is super clean." Even though dentists have been, and already are, extremely vigilant about sanitation, it’s important to talk about it and let your patients know the steps you’re taking to keep them safe.</p>
							<p>As you open a new pack of tools, say, “These tools have been sanitized using our sanitization process which includes…”. That little bit of information goes a long way when it comes to client safety.</p>
							<h4>2. Minimize interactions with people</h4>
							<p>Social distancing is one of the main ways we can all do our part to stop the spread of the virus. Your patients want to avoid unnecessary contact with people, and one of the ways you can do that is by allowing for contactless check-in, plexiglass between your front desk team and your patients, and ensuring that your waiting room is always empty.</p>
							<p>Many patients are worried there will be a rush of visitors to the dentist, with one saying “"I imagine dentists will be crowded, so I won't plan on going until I feel things have slowed down." To combat this, send an email to your patients who are due for a cleaning or had a cancellation or call them and let them know what you’re doing to minimize foot traffic in your office.</p>
							<p>One great suggestion from our survey respondents was: "A virtual waiting room please, so I don’t have to wait in a line outside the office." This is a great time to use technology to our advantage. Use apps, like Opencare, to communicate with your patients and iPads to check in. Ask your patients to wait in the car and give them a call or text when it’s time to come in so only one patient enters at a time.</p>
							<h4>3. Display safety standards and proof of infection control</h4>
							<p>When we asked our patients how they felt about their dentist having proof of infection control and following proper sanitation guidelines, 29% said they felt very confident and trusted their dentist to follow proper protocol. Another 40% said they felt confident, while 18% said they felt worried and 12% said they felt very worried and would want to see certification or proof.</p>
							<p>Much like our first suggestion, make safety visible to ease your patient's mind. Display things like signs and symptoms of COVID-19, reminders to sanitize and wash hands for your staff, and you can even email your patient ahead of their appointments or message them on Opencare with a “What we’re doing to keep you safe” message.</p>
							<h4>Be the expert for your patients</h4>
							<p>As a dentist, it’s your role to be a wellness partner for your patient. Keep your patients up-to-date on dental regulations, new data and information, studies, and anything related to their oral wellness and COVID-19. Get ahead of the information and share it freely with your patients. This could be being active on social media or sending out a monthly email newsletter.</p>
							<p>When we asked our patients who they go to for information for questions and concerns about their oral health during the COVID-19 pandemic, 21% said they call their dentist, with 66% saying the turn to Google. A small number of patients turn to friends and family (7%), with only 2% turning to social media and other avenues.</p>
							<p>Patients want to hear from their dentist! In times of uncertainty and in a health crisis, your patients are going to look to you for the most accurate information. They trust you with their oral health, and it’s important that you instill confidence and are there for them as their partner. By doing this, you can set yourself apart from your competition and excel in patient excellence.</p>

							<h3>Chapter 4:</h3>
							<h2>Keeping your office’s engine safe and supported</h2>
							<p>Written by Samie Durnford, Health and Wellness Writer and Dr. Jeanie Luong</p>
						</div>
						<div class="main-content_content">
							<p>Your team is the backbone of your practice, and it’s important to not only ease their minds, but to keep them safe every day they step into your office to work with patients. Chances are, your team is a little bit weary about working with COVID-19, even if they’re putting on a brave face. Understandably, dental offices everywhere are feeling a bit worried from time to time about what this whole pandemic means to them, and wonder if they’re doing everything possible to keep their office safe from the virus.</p>
							<p>Confidence is key, and the first step to keeping your office safe is being confident that you are doing everything possible to keep your office clean, your patients safe, and your employees trained and equipped to do the same.</p>
							<h4>How to keep your staff safe</h4>
							<h4>1. Train your staff on national dental regulations and safety precautions</h4>
							<p>As the age old saying goes: knowledge is power. The best thing you can do to keep your staff safe is make sure that they’re informed about everything they need to know about COVID-19. It’s your main priority to ensure that everyone at your office understands how to keep themselves, and their colleagues, safe at work.</p>
							<p>The first step is being up-to-date on the dental guidelines relevant to your region.</p>
							<h4>2. Make sure they have all the supplies they need</h4>
							<p>Have your practice fully stocked with sanitizer and sanitizing stations, the right level of disinfectant for cleaning, personal protective equipment, physical barriers at contact points, and any other measures you’re taking to keep the office clean from viruses. Running out of any of the required necessities could not only affect the safety of your employees or patients, but it may mean that you must close your practice until new inventory arrives. It’s imperative your staff has the tools they need to execute safety protocols.</p>
							<h4>3. Enable your staff to turn patients away if they’re unsure</h4>
							<p>Turning away a potentially sick or at-risk patient might feel overwhelming to people like your front desk staff, whose sole responsibility is being accommodating and friendly to patients. With pre-screening over the phone, and screening upon entry (such as temperature checks), your front desk staff are the first contact patients have with your practice. This means your front desk team are likely the gatekeepers of who should be able to make an appointment, and who comes through your front doors. While regulations state that you turn away anyone deemed at-risk, it can still feel like a daunting task.</p>
							<p>The best thing you can do is support your team when they make judgement calls and let them know that you trust their judgement no matter what. Also let them know that you have an open door if they have any hesitations or questions when it comes to booking patients. Now is the time where it’s okay to say no to a patient – it’s not worth the risk of bringing the virus into your practice.</p>
							<h4>4. Empower your staff</h4>
							<p>Let your staff know that you support them in the decisions they make. If they feel unsafe in a work situation, like a colleague may be sick, or they feel like they shouldn’t be coming into work because they may have had contact with someone sick, it’s important that you make it known that you’ll have their back without any repercussions. An open and honest team is a safe team, and you want all your employees to come to you if they have any concerns regarding health and safety.</p>
							<h4>5. Be diligent with your staff</h4>
							<p>Screening your staff daily is an important measure that will keep your entire team (and your patients) safe. It’s important to ask the COVID screening questions every day, before your team comes into the office. By doing so, you’re keeping open lines of communication and encouraging employees to share if any circumstances have changed surrounding their health. Screening employees can help stop the spread of infection should one of your employees come into contact with the virus.</p>
							<p>Even though you know them, trust them, and feel like they know the protocols, it’s important to not let employee screenings slide. A thorough team is a safe team.</p>
							<h4>Resources for your staff</h4>
							<p>It’s your job to make sure that your staff has access to the information and tools necessary to keep both them and your patients safe. Aside from supplying the right inventory and tools for your employees, here are a few other things you can do to make sure your staff have all the resources they need.</p>
							<h4>1. Send out a weekly COVID-19 information email</h4>
							<p>Send out weekly updates to your staff about how the office has been doing in terms of sanitization, booking patients, screening, and all other protocols. Congratulate them on all their hard work, call out the Safety Heroes, and discuss opportunities to improve. Encourage two-way communication and ask your employees to contribute to this memo as well.</p>
							<p>Include links to new research about COVID-19, specifically anything related to dental as well so everyone in your office is knowledgeable.</p>
							<h4>2. Stay the most up-to-date on new regulations and protocol</h4>
							<p>You should be the first person who knows of any changes in safety, sanitation, or dental protocol and government regulations for the industry. When a significant change happens, alert your staff. You can also put a section in your weekly email with any relevant updates that aren’t time sensitive but are worth knowing.</p>
							<h4>3. Have sanitation reminders</h4>
							<p>Pick a song, ring a bell, ask one of your team members to go around and do something silly, or whatever works for your office culture, to remind people to stop what they’re doing (if possible) and wash their hands, sanitize their station, and any other safety protocols that need to happen frequently. Much like how grocery stores have reminders on the announcement systems in store reminding their employees to wash their hands, you can do the same in your office. This activity will help your patients feel at ease, too.</p>
							<h4>4. Have posters around the office with information for public health and COVID-19 hotlines</h4>
							<p>While it may seem like common knowledge, it’s important to have posters that list the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and where to go/where to call if anyone thinks they may be showing signs or symptoms. These posters should be up around your office in visible areas, and you should have more than one. Have one in your waiting room for patients as well.</p>
							<h4>5. Consider new technology and tools</h4>
							<p>Technology can help remove a lot of face-to-face interactions and can help keep your team safe. Things like appointment bookings, streamlining insurance claims or questions, and teledentistry are all available to limit the time patients need to spend with your front desk staff. Now is the time to implement a new tool that will not only keep your team safe, but also help your team be more efficient. We’ll talk more about technology and tools in Chapter 7.</p>
							<h4>6. Have benefits to support your staff</h4>
							<p>While it goes without saying that you should let your employees know that they’ll have access to sick leave should they get sick, you can also provide them with other benefits. An option is to increase their insurance Health Care Spending account to help cover things like grocery delivery, extra detergent for clothes washing, and other COVID-19 distancing services. It’s up to you how much your practice can help, but it’s important to let your staff know that you support them making the safest choices.</p>
							<p>Remember, your team is the backbone to your practice and they’re the ones who are going that extra mile to make sure your practice and patients are safe. Your job as a dentist is to enable every single employee and encourage them to take the lead on their safety and the safety of the practice.</p>

							<h2>Is Teledentistry the new norm? Best Practices for Screening Patients</h2>
							<p>Written by Samie Durnford, Health and Wellness Writer and Dr. Natalie Archer DDS</p>
						</div>
						<div class="main-content_content">
							<p>The topic of teledentistry is top of mind as an emerging industry now that COVID-19 has challenged dentists to think of where the future of their practice is headed. Teledentistry allows you to screen patients before they come into your practice to ensure they aren’t sick and haven’t been in contact with, or in a situation with COVID-19. It also allows you to understand patients' dental problems and screen them accordingly to best serve them.</p>
							<h4>What does teledentistry look like?</h4>
							<p>Teledentistry is essentially a virtual visit using technology that allows you to communicate and gain information from your patient off-site. It may look like:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><span>Live video</span> - Communicating with patients via secure video chat tools</li>
								<li><span>Remote patient monitoring</span> - Collecting personal health and medical data from an individual to your practice</li>
								<li><span>Mobile health</span> - Leveraging cell phones and tablets to communicate with your patients</li>
								<li><span>Store-and-forward tools</span> - Sharing health records and information via a secure electronic communication system to a practitioner outside of a real-time or live meeting</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Teledentistry will most obviously be used for COVID-19 screening before a patient makes an appointment, but it can also be used for emergency and urgent care needs and non-essential care. Non-essential care via teledentistry can be things like patient advice or counselling, assessing and evaluation needs, monitoring or follow-up after procedures, and consultations or treatment planning.</p>
							<h4>Is teledentistry the new norm?</h4>
							<p>Screening virtually is a great and innovative service, and likely to continue to rise in popularity for dentists. As dental offices get more comfortable with using teledentistry technology to interact with patients, one can expect that it will be used beyond screening patients for COVID-19. We live in a highly connected, digital world and many patients prefer to interact with businesses via their phone or from the comfort of their own home. Especially now, in a world where people feel much safer limiting in-person interactions and are more comfortable using technology.</p>
							<p>Teledentistry is a great tool to consult online or over the phone to ease patient minds. You can save their time, and the time of your entire practice, by keeping bums out of seats that don’t have to be there. If you can consult or plan treatments over the phone, then that means you can have patients in your office getting procedures done and schedule the rest accordingly.</p>
							<p>Also, teledentistry is innovative and will be something your patients will come to expect. For example, chat bots are a fast way to screen appointments and patients love the convenience, speed, and easy access.</p>
							<h4>Will teledentistry ever truly replace the check up?</h4>
							<p>Yes and no. Teledentistry is most effective for patients who have already been into your office to see you. Without any clinical measurements or past x-rays, it’s hard to advise patients calling in. For screening it’s great but for examinations, it also currently has limitations. Teledentistry is a great door opener for information and an adjunct to in-person appointments, but it likely won’t be replacing in-person dentistry anytime soon.</p>
							<p>However, there are opportunities for dentists being assisted by teledentistry and digital dentistry. Some parts of the appointment and checkup are easily replaceable and conveniently solved by digital and teledentistry, but for actual exams, in person will still be extremely important for patients.</p>
							<p>When it comes to screening for COVID-19, teledentistry is one of the best ways. It keeps potentially sick people out of your office, and keeps your staff safe.</p>
							<h4>COVID-19 teledentistry screening checklist</h4>
							<p>When you’re screening over the phone, it’s important to ask the COVID-19 patient screening questions outlined by your Ministry of Health guidelines.</p>
							<p><span>Q1:</span> Have you had any close contact with anyone with acute respiratory Illness or have travelled outside of Ontario in the past 14 days?</p>
							<p><span>Q2:</span> Have you had a confirmed case of COVID-19 or had close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19?</p>
							<p><span>Q3:</span> Does you have any of the following symptoms:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Fever</li>
								<li>New onset of cough</li>
								<li>Worsening chronic cough</li>
								<li>Shortness of breath</li>
								<li>Difficulty breathing</li>
								<li>Sore throat</li>
								<li>Difficulty swallowing</li>
								<li>Decrease or loss of sense of taste or smell</li>
								<li>Chills</li>
								<li>Headaches</li>
								<li>Unexplained fatigue/malaise/muscle aches (myalgias)</li>
								<li>Nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain</li>
								<li>Pink eye (conjunctivitis)</li>
								<li>Runny nose/nasal congestion without other known cause</li>
							</ul>
							<p><span>Q4:</span> If the person is 70 years of age or older, ask if they are experiencing any of the following symptoms: delirium, unexplained or increased number of falls, acute functional decline, or worsening of chronic conditions?</p>
							<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">COVID-19 Screening Results</span></p>
							<p>If response to <span>ALL</span> of the screening questions is <span>NO: COVID Screen Negative</span></p>
							<p>If response to <span>ANY</span> of the screening questions is <span>YES: COVID Screen Positive</span></p>
							<p>After mandatory COVID screening, you can also use the teledentistry screening to screen your patients for anything else that is relevant to booking them in for an appointment at your practice. You can use the screening as a time to help your office prioritize booking or decide whether you want to take them on as a new patient. We’ll talk more about prioritizing patients in Chapter 7.</p>
							<p><span>Optional additional questions:</span></p>
							<ol>
								<li>Are you in immediate pain or discomfort?</li>
								<li>When was the last time you visited a dentist (if you’re unable to tell, or they’re not a patient from your practice)?</li>
								<li>Are you comfortable wearing a mask, having your temperature taken, and other office safety protocols?</li>
							</ol>
							<h4>Using technology to improve patient flow</h4>
							<p>Technology helps you screen patients for safety, but it also acts as a buffer to help inform which patients you would like to come into your office and in what priority. With the COVID-19 closures being lifted, dental offices will likely see a spike in patients wanting to get into your office to get work done. It’s important to understand how you would like your office prioritizing booking and use technology to improve patient flow.</p>
							<h4>Here are a few tools that can help improve patient flow:</h4>
							<ol>
								<li><span>Mobile health screening</span> – Invest in an app to help you connect with your patients from their mobile devices</li>
								<li><span>Online booking</span> – Use Opencare to communicate with patients and book all appointments online</li>
								<li><span>Tablets</span> – Allow your patients to check in using a tablet, rather than requiring them to speak with your staff. It’s safer for both your staff and the patient, and quick and easy. Sanitize after every use.</li>
								<li><span>Chat bots & social media</span> – Chat bots are a tool you can use on your social media messaging systems, like Facebook, that can direct patient questions to the right portal, like Opencare for booking or your app for screening</li>
								<li><span>Electronic health records (EHR)</span> – Having all records electronic will help your team be more efficient, run insurance checks, and manage other patient tasks quickly as they pop up</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Technology is an investment from a financial and time perspective, but it can help you maximize your team’s productivity, improve patient experience, and generate more revenue. As COVID-19 has changed the way we all interact, there’s no better time to implement innovative tools into your practice.</p>

							<h2>Managing cash flow and unlocking revenue</h2>
							<p>By Dana Apuy, Dental Billing Specialist</p>
						</div>
						<div class="main-content_content">
							<p>There are many new challenges dental practices are facing due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges present a unique opportunity to analyze previous practice behaviors, search for improvements, and implement new procedures to increase productivity and efficiency.</p>
							<p>An essential focus of any dental practice is to continue to generate and to maintain a steady revenue regardless of any encountered unique COVID-19 circumstances. The bread and butter of most practices is the acceptance of all insurance plans; this generally accounts for 90% of the practice’s incoming revenue, with 15-20% of patients paying cash.</p>
							<p>A disruption in this cash flow can cause serious setbacks within your practice, especially during this difficult time. To avoid any potential issues, here are four steps to ensure steady cash flow to your dental practice during the COVID-19 pandemic:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<span>Audit Outstanding Insurance Claims</span>
									<p class="ol-content">Regular auditing of aging insurance accounts can reveal numerous outstanding claims at risk of exceeding a timely filing. If these insurance accounts are allowed to extend beyond the established time limits, you could risk losing thousands of dollars in revenue. Here are some of the best auditing practices:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><span>Develop an auditing schedule.</span> A routine auditing schedule and procedure in your practice will not only save you time and money but also earn your practice increased revenue as well.</li>
										<li><span>Be aware of filing time limits.</span> A practice well versed in filing time limits has a good basis when developing an auditing schedule. For example, government plans and Ameritas usually have a timely filing limit of 90 days, while commercial plans typically have a limit of 12-24 months. Keeping these different time limits in mind will assist you in keeping your practice’s schedule on track and will also avoid increased work burden on staff by unnecessary repetitive auditing.</li>
										<li><span>Check for completion of electronic transmissions.</span> Sometimes these fail to submit, and transmissions do not make it to the clearinghouse or insurance company. Without a timestamp from your clearinghouse, you can lose out on a timely filing appeal and money for those claims.</li>
										<li><span>Gather missing documentation.</span> Other claims could be on file but still pending additional documentation, which can easily be faxed or emailed over for quick processing.</li>
										<li><span>Monitor orthodontic claims.</span> Keep in mind that some carriers require an orthodontic statement to receive quarterly payments.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>Check Patient Balances</span>
									<p class="ol-content">Uncollected balances and cancelled/missed appointments are a source of lost revenue. Many people are experiencing significant lifestyle changes in this current COVID-19 environment. They may simply need a reminder about any upcoming appointments, as well as previous balances or co-pays due.</p>
									<ul>
										<li><span>Consider sending daily statements.</span> Regular statements can be useful for patients that make partial payments or for any balances resulting in a patient co-pay after insurance has paid.</li>
										<li><span>Review cancelled treatments/approaching patient appointments.</span> Consider asking for a deposit to secure appointments and to remind patients of their upcoming due balances.</li>
										<li><span>Explore a membership program/financing option.</span> Some patients are experiencing hardship due to COVID-19. Address this by setting up a membership program. Offering multiple financing options for patients allows flexibility and accountability.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>Adjust Insurance/Practice Fees</span>
									<p class="ol-content">The majority of insurance fees are calculated by the yearly utilization and cash fees reported by each dentist in your area. If your cash fees are hovering around the 40% range and your neighbor/colleague is hovering around 80%, then your practice is not on an even playing field with respect to the insurance carriers. As such, you could be at risk for not receiving higher fee increase updates, unlike your neighboring dentist.</p>
									<ul>
										<li><span>Perform a yearly checkup.</span> Establish a protocol to check your UCR “cash fees” to even out the competitive field.</li>
										<li><span>Consider how your practice is networked.</span> Are you contracted with the highest paying network? Insurance carriers will compare how many networks you are sharing and pay the lowest fee possible.</li>
										<li><span>Increase fees.</span> Consider increasing fees 5%-15% across-the-board to compensate for PPE costs.</li>
										<li><span>Conduct a marketing campaign.</span> Target high-dollar procedures and schedule high-production patients at 50% of your schedule over the next eight weeks. Fill in smaller procedures whenever possible.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>Apply Updated CDT Codes</span>
									<p class="ol-content">A successful dental practice knows the value of being familiar with current CDT codes. The ADA has announced newly updated guidelines designed to aid practices in adapting to COVID-19 guidelines. Keeping your practice on track with updated coding knowledge as well as how to implement new codes in billing practices ensures revenue is being generated for procedures and work being completed during unique situations encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic. A couple of other notable codes include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><span>D1999 - COVID-19 PPE Cost.</span> As practices continue to follow diligent COVID-19 guidelines to promote health and safety within the dental practice, this can help meet PPE resource needs.</li>
										<li><span>D9995/D9996 - Tele-dentistry.</span> Some carriers will pay for a tele-dentistry code or a D0140 when billed in conjunction. Both codes must be billed together to be considered for reimbursement. Check with your state insurance policies to see if tele-dentistry is allowed in your state.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>We know this is a difficult time, and decreased patient flow has brought new challenges for earning the money your practice needs to thrive. Staying on top of simple audits, patient balances, and balancing your fees can help unlock the cash flow you need to support your dental office.</p>

							<h3>Chapter 7:</h3>
							<h2>Becoming the practice you’ve always wanted to be</h2>
							<p>By Cam Howieson, CEO and Samie Durnford, Health and Wellness Writer</p>
						</div>
						<div class="main-content_content">
							<h4>Do you want to be the practice you were? Or the practice you’ve always wanted to be?</h4>
							<p>There was no way we could have predicted that our reality would be shaken upside down and reimagined by a pandemic. While the dental industry has felt the effects of COVID-19 substantially, it’s also worth noting that dentists are a resilient bunch.</p>
							<p>Yes, the pandemic has made dentists across the world rethink their practice – that’s no secret. While it’s been a huge shift for dentists to make the changes necessary to protect their patients and practice from the virus, there are also big opportunities that can come from our new reality.</p>
							<h4>Become the practice you want to be</h4>
							<p>Aside from added sanitization and guiding your patients through the process to ensure they feel safe visiting your practice, now is the time to implement change for the better. What else can your practice do to use this time of change to create impactful, long-term changes for their practice?</p>
							<p>Now is the time for dentists to shift their mindset when it comes to the overall patient experience, post-pandemic and beyond. We’re not talking just about safety. We’re talking about thinking about which patients you should partner with to grow your practice stronger.</p>
							<p>Let’s face it – patients take up a lot of your time and with new sanitization standards and keeping your office clean and safe in between patients, it’s important that every single patient is worth your time. Now, more than ever, your team needs to focus on the things that matter.</p>
							<p>On top of that, it’s imperative that your practice can run as efficiently and safely as possible to bounce back from the pandemic and beyond COVID-19. This might mean implementing new technology or processes that you weren’t able to before. You can use this immense time of change as an opportunity to reimagine your practice.</p>
							<p>So, how do you do it? Let’s explore.</p>
							<h4>The ideal patient</h4>
							<p>At Opencare, we think a lot about the right kinds of dentists for our patients. But, we also know that a patient-dentist relationship is a partnership. Just like we encourage our patients to not just choose any ol’ dentist, we encourage our dentists to do the same when it comes to patients.</p>
							<h4>Why is choosing the right patient important?</h4>
							<p>It’s important to think about what a good quality patient means to you because not all patients are created equal. Some patients build your business, while others can drain your business. It’s important for dentists to understand the difference between the two, and know what to do with both types of patients.</p>
							<p>Given the new prescreening required with COVID-19, now is an opportunity to screen patients before they come into your practice to gauge not only are they safe to bring into your practice, but also to see if they’re the right patients you want sitting in your chairs.</p>
							<p>The bottom line is this: You have limited time to see patients, and you want to make sure you’re bringing in patients that are high value and need work done.</p>
							<p>So, what types of patients do you want sitting in your chairs?</p>
							<h4>Meet: The Wellness Seeker</h4>
							<p>At Opencare, we call the ideal patient a Wellness Seeker. A Wellness Seeker is someone who:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Prioritizes their health and wellness</li>
								<li>Take care of themselves physically, exercises</li>
								<li>Care about nutrition</li>
								<li>Proactive about the things that will benefit their health in the long term</li>
								<li>Often millennials and young adults who believe they can and deserve to have the life they’ve always dreamed of. They set big goals for themselves and plan to live long and happy lives.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Wellness Seekers are the type of person who goes to yoga once a week, cares about the food they eat, and makes investments in their health in other ways, like seeing a naturopath or other health and wellness support.</p>
							<p>These patients are important to your practice because they’re going to trust you, as a partner in their wellness. They work with you to take proactive steps for their oral health, and they trust you to do the right work when required and come to you for more than just a pain that pops up. They don’t waste your time!</p>
							<h4>Meet: The Couch Potato</h4>
							<p>Counter to the Wellness Seeker, we have the Couch Potato. These patients might have a mouth full of cavities and work to be done, but they’re not the high-value patients you may think they are. Couch Potatoes are people who:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Are not proactive about their health – only seek healthcare professionals when they have an issue</li>
								<li>Only take care of their mouth by visiting the dentist</li>
								<li>Don’t care about nutrition or exercise</li>
								<li>Don’t have the intent of bettering their lives or health</li>
							</ul>
							<p>These patients ignore their health until their body tells them otherwise. They may come to you when they need work done and rack up a big bill, but they’re not going to listen to your advice and care for their mouth the way you recommend. They waste your time, because they come into your office for work when needed but don’t engage with you any other way. They take up time that you can be spending with Wellness Seekers.</p>
							<h4>High intent + high needs = the best patient for you</h4>
							<p>High intent patients are patients who care about their health, wellness and doing the right things to live a healthy life.</p>
							<p>The amount of work part of the equation means just that: how much work does a patient need? Needs can range from a cleaning, to fillings, to other oral health needs.</p>
							<p>While these two things together, high needs + high intent make the absolute perfect patient, it’s all about balance. You don’t need both together to have a good patient for your practice.</p>
							<p>Instead, it might look like this:</p>
							<p><span>Scenario one:</span> You have a patient who needs a lot of work but doesn’t overly care about their health. They’re a bit of a couch potato, but deep down you can tell they want to do better. You partner with them to talk about their goals for their dental health and point them in the right direction for full body wellness. You send them resources via email, check up with them on social media, and send them offers via your monthly marketing outreach. You turn that patient from low intent, to high intent.</p>
							<p><span>Scenario two:</span> You have a patient that lives an incredibly healthy life and high intent but doesn’t require more than their regular cleanings. However, you want to ensure that this patient is loyal to your practice, because you know down the line they may need a root canal, crown, or other dental work. Again, you partner with them about their goals and use your marketing efforts and engagement outreach to show them that your practice is serious about full body wellness and working with patients to achieve wellness goals. When that patient feels like something is amiss with their mouth, they come to you for a consult and trust your advice.</p>
							<p>It’s important to figure out where your patients are at in their intent + needs journey and meet them where they are. Building a relationship is important for all dentists to do with their patients, and through doing that, you can better prioritize what patients to bring into your practice and which patients to deprioritize.</p>
							<h4>How to change your practice for the better</h4>
							<p>Now that you know what patients you need to build your practice, here are the things you can implement along with your other new COVID-19 strategies once you reopen.</p>
							<h4>1. Use screening to identify where your patients are at in terms of intent</h4>
							<p>While you’re screening patients for COVID-19, ask them about their last treatment and what they’re looking to have done. Have your front office team look up these patients and scan their history. Are they patients that come to you frequently for a variety of needs? If so, book them in if they have the all-clear COVID screening. If not, you can consider booking them further out or find opportunities to book them further out or ultimately turn them away if you feel they’re not a good use of time.</p>
							<p>Remember, your practice’s time is going to be extra valuable now that the new normal requires extra time with patients, cleaning and prepping, and screening. Don’t feel bad being honest with yourself or the team about whether a patient is right for your practice. Enable your staff to make the right decisions and support them with their choices.</p>
							<h4>2. Engage and encourage intent</h4>
							<p>Use tools like email marketing, eBooks, special offers and discounts, and other marketing tools to engage Wellness Seekers and change the intent of patients who aren’t quite wellness seekers yet. As a practice, you want to build loyalty with your Wellness Seekers and convert your middle-of-the-road patients into Wellness Seekers.</p>
							<p>Dentistry is a business, and it’s important to connect with your patients and drive an elevated patient experience outside of just safety in the new COVID world. Be your patients’ partners when it comes to their health and wellness, and work with them to become the person their want to be by helping them realize their goals, steps to being healthier, and guiding them to a healthy lifestyle.</p>
							<h4>3. Instill the confidence to your patients</h4>
							<p>It’s important for your practice to live the wellness mantra and be the Wellness Seeker you hope to see in your patients. There’s no better time to get your whole practice onside with living a healthy lifestyle and being the image, you hope your patients follow. Your team has been working hard to get your practice ready to open safely for your patients, so thank them by rewarding them with healthy lifestyle incentives. Maybe it’s an incentive to buy a new piece of home fitness equipment, or a healthy lunch on Fridays. Big or small, help your team discover what wellness means to them and encourage it.</p>
							<h4>Change management and technology – How to use a crisis to create change for the better</h4>
							<p>Another silver-lining of this pandemic is that it’s forced dental practices to embrace a lot of change in a short period of time. Like any business, it’s easy for us to get stuck in our ways. Dental practices, especially, can be stuck in the “well, that’s how we’ve done it for years” traps. Your team is loyal, and you are loyal to them – but that doesn’t mean everyone is open to reimagining your practice and embracing new technology.</p>
							<p>While you move to make the patient experience safer for your patients and your team, now is a great time to introduce new technology. Technology is a great tool to make things safer, easier, more efficient, and allow your employees to focus on the right kind of patient experience.</p>
							<h4>Bad technology wastes time and clouds the patient experience</h4>
							<p>Your employees are now spending time sanitizing, screening, and guiding patients through the new process and those are all important things that should be prioritized. Your team’s time should be spent doing the things that matter, not the things that waste their time like booking appointments on slow, old booking systems and spending time on the phone with insurance companies as patients start to cluster in the waiting room.</p>
							<p>In our new reality, patient and employee safety is paramount and technological hiccups can make your practice less safe. Patients shouldn’t be lined up to pay a bill as your receptionist fiddles with the fax machine, asks for more documents, or calls insurance companies. Booking new appointments or checking in can be done online or on an iPad to avoid face-to-face interactions, and the quicker your patients are handled, the less time they’re spent in the waiting room trying to socially distance themselves from other patients.</p>
							<h4>Implement change now to free up your employee’s time to better focus on patient experience (and make their job safer)</h4>
							<p>If your team was previously hesitant or scared to use technology at work, maybe due to the fear of losing their job to a new tool, then now is the time to show them that technology can make their job safer and allow them to focus on things they enjoy doing (like helping patients).</p>
							<p>You can use this time to show them how technology can make their job safer and easier. You can use COVID as a chance to have these conversations about new tools and make changes that your team had previously been resistant to by reframing the conversations.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Introduce technology to reduce administrative burden</li>
								<li>Explain how technology makes their job safer</li>
								<li>Show that technology can allow them to spend more time with patients</li>
							</ol>
							<p>In the long run, technology will allow your team to provide more patient support which will differentiate your practice from the one down the street. Patients have been embracing technology as they stayed at home, moved their jobs online, and interacted with their favorite brands and essential services digitally.
